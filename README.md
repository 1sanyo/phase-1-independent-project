# phase-1-independent-project

This website was created by me to develop my HTML,javascript and CSS skills. It is created for a small generic retail business which sells trainers. I created the concept image from scratch and based the website on that.

To get a copy of the website download the repository as a zip file and extract it to a location of your choosing. Then open index.html in your browser to view the website or open any of the html or css files in a text editor to view the source code.

A text editor for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
A web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
